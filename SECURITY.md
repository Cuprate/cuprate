# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest version available as it follows monero specifications and older client is therefore prohibited by the network.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you ever discover a vulnerability, please do not open a github issue. Contact us by mail directly using our pgp keys under the gpg_keys folder in the repository. We're also available on Matrix.
You can also alert us using the *Report a Vulnerability* feature of Github. Thanks for being quiet. We'll always disclose the vulnerability after patching it and encourage everyone to fetch the
security update.
