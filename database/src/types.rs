//! ### Types module
//! This module contains definition and implementations of some of the structures stored in the database.
//! Some of these types are just Wrapper for convenience or re-definition of `monero-rs` database type (see Boog900/monero-rs, "db" branch)
//! Since the database do not use dummy keys, these redefined structs are the same as monerod without the prefix data used as a key.
//! All these types implement [`bincode::Encode`] and [`bincode::Decode`]. They can store `monero-rs` types in their field. In this case, these field
//! use the [`Compat<T>`] wrapper.
