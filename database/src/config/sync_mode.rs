//! Database [`Env`](crate::Env) configuration.
//!
//! This module contains the main [`Config`]uration struct
//! for the database [`Env`](crate::Env)ironment, and data
//! structures related to any configuration setting.
//!
//! These configurations are processed at runtime, meaning
//! the `Env` can/will dynamically adjust its behavior
//! based on these values.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SyncMode
/// Disk synchronization mode.
///
/// This controls how/when the database syncs its data to disk.
///
/// Regardless of the variant chosen, dropping [`Env`](crate::Env)
/// will always cause it to fully sync to disk.
///
/// # Sync vs Async
/// All invariants except [`SyncMode::Async`] & [`SyncMode::Fast`]
/// are `synchronous`, as in the database will wait until the OS has
/// finished syncing all the data to disk before continuing.
///
/// `SyncMode::Async` & `SyncMode::Fast` are `asynchronous`, meaning
/// the database will _NOT_ wait until the data is fully synced to disk
/// before continuing. Note that this doesn't mean the database itself
/// won't be synchronized between readers/writers, but rather that the
/// data _on disk_ may not be immediately synchronized after a write.
///
/// Something like:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// db.put("key", value);
/// db.get("key");
/// ```
/// will be fine, most likely pulling from memory instead of disk.
///
/// # TODO
/// Dynamic sync's are not yet supported.
///
/// Only:
///
/// - [`SyncMode::Safe`]
/// - [`SyncMode::Async`]
/// - [`SyncMode::Fast`]
///
/// are supported, all other variants will panic on [`crate::Env::open`].
