Cuprate crates are licensed under one of two licenses, either MIT or AGPL-3.0,
depending on the crate in question. Each crate declares their license in their
`Cargo.toml`. Additionally, a full copy of both licenses are included in the
root of this repository for reference. These copies should be provided with
any distribution of a crate, as per the respective license's terms.

All documentation, including the books in the `books/` directory, is licensed
under the MIT license.
