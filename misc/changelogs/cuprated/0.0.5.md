## Changes
- Define Tor Zone, add onion addressing and more ([#481](https://github.com/Cuprate/cuprate/pull/481))
- Update `fast-sync` to height `3456000` ([#502](https://github.com/Cuprate/cuprate/pull/502))

- RPC: enable `submit_block` and `/send_raw_transaction` ([#515](https://github.com/Cuprate/cuprate/pull/515))

## Downloads
For convenience, the following binaries are produced using GitHub CI in a non-reproducible way; it is highly recommended to build `cuprated` from source instead, see <https://user.cuprate.org/getting-started/source>.
