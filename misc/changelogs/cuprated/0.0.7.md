# cuprated 0.0.7 Molybdenite (2025-10-08)
Cuprate is an alternative Monero node implementation. To get started, see: <https://user.cuprate.org>.

## Changes
- Update `monero_oxide` ([#543](https://github.com/Cuprate/cuprate/pull/543))
- Add `pop_blocks` command ([#545](https://github.com/Cuprate/cuprate/pull/545))
- Fix `DefaultOrCustom<T>` docs ([#550](https://github.com/Cuprate/cuprate/pull/550))

## Downloads
For convenience, the following binaries are produced using GitHub CI in a non-reproducible way; it is highly recommended to build `cuprated` from source instead, see <https://user.cuprate.org/getting-started/source>.
