# Requests
Along with the 2 handles, there are 2 types of requests:
- Read requests, e.g. [`BlockchainReadRequest`](https://doc.cuprate.org/cuprate_types/blockchain/enum.BlockchainReadRequest.html)
- Write requests, e.g. [`BlockchainWriteRequest`](https://doc.cuprate.org/cuprate_types/blockchain/enum.BlockchainWriteRequest.html)

Quite obviously:
- Read requests are for retrieving various data from the database
- Write requests are for writing data to the databases
