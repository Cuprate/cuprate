# ðŸŸ  RPC
`monerod`'s daemon RPC has three kinds of RPC calls:
1. [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) methods, called at the `/json_rpc` endpoint
1. JSON (but not JSON-RPC 2.0) methods called at their own endpoints, e.g. [`/get_height`](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/developer-guides/daemon-rpc.html#get_height)
1. Binary ([epee](../../formats-protocols-types/epee.html)) RPC methods called at their own endpoints ending in `.bin`, e.g. `/get_blocks.bin`

Cuprate's RPC aims to mimic `monerod`'s as much as it can practically can.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Using the same endpoints
- Receiving the same request data
- Sending the same response data
- Responding with the same HTTP status codes
- Following internal behavior (e.g. [`/pop_blocks`](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/developer-guides/daemon-rpc.html#pop_blocks))

Not all `monerod` behavior can always be followed, however.

Some cannot be followed due to technical limitations, and some cannot due to the behavior being `monerod` specific,
such as the [`/set_log_categories`](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/developer-guides/daemon-rpc.html#set_log_categories)
endpoint, which uses `monerod`'s logging categories.

Both subtle and large differences between Cuprate's RPC and `monerod`'s RPC are documented in the [Differences with `monerod`](differences/intro.md) section.

## Original definitions
The main `monerod` definition of the sections talked about in this chapter are below.

The first defines some data structures, the second contains macros that (essentially) implement JSON-RPC 2.0.
