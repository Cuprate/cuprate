# Message Flows

Message flows are sets of messages sent between peers, that achieve an identifiable goal, like a handshake.
Some message flows are complex, involving many message types, whereas others are simple, requiring only 1.

The message flows here are not every possible request/response.

When documenting checks on the messages, not all checks are documented, only the ones notable. This should help
to reduce the maintenance burden.
