//! Difficulty Module
//!
//! This module handles keeping track of the data required to calculate block difficulty.
//! This data is currently the cumulative difficulty of each block and its timestamp.
//!
//! The timestamps are also used in other consensus rules so instead of duplicating the same
//! data in a different cache, the timestamps needed are retrieved from here.
