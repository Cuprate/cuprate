//! Cuprate Consensus
//!
//! This crate contains Monero [`block`] and [`transactions`] verification functionality.
//!
//! This crate is generic over the database which is implemented as a [`tower::Service`]. To
//! implement a database you need to have a service which accepts [`BlockchainReadRequest`] and responds
//! with [`BlockchainResponse`].
