//! Cuprate Consensus
//!
//! This crate contains 3 [`tower::Service`]s that implement Monero's consensus rules:
//!
//! - [`BlockChainContextService`] Which handles keeping the current state of the blockchain.
//! - [`BlockVerifierService`] Which handles block verification.
//! - [`TxVerifierService`] Which handles transaction verification.
//!
//! This crate is generic over the database which is implemented as a [`tower::Service`]. To
//! implement a database you need to have a service which accepts [`BlockchainReadRequest`] and responds
//! with [`BlockchainResponse`].
//!
