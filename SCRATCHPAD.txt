RPC stuff that needs to be written in the architecture book:

## General
- diagram showing full pipeline from input to output with crate responsibilities listed along the line

## The handler
- {json-rpc, binary, other} handler functions implemented in `cuprated` <CODE_LINK>
- handler -> helper function -> internal component's `Service`

## Unsupported RPC calls / RPC calls with different behavior
- https://github.com/Cuprate/cuprate/issues/278
- binary strings -> full JSON: `get_transaction_pool_backlog`, `get_output_distribution`
- not in `monerod` yet: `get_tx_ids_loose`
