# This file consists of rules determining which labels the
# `github-actions` bot should automatically label an issue/PR with.
# The CI that actually applies labels is in `.github/workflows/labeler.yml`.
#
# The main one used is the "if a file changed" rule.
# The format for this rule is:
#
# ```
# $LABEL_NAME:
# - changed-files:
#   - any-glob-to-any-file: $PATH
# ```
#
# where $PATH can be:
#   $DIRECTORY/*
# which means any file changed 1 level deep inside that directory or:
#   $DIRECTORY/**
# which means any file changed within that directory or:
#   $DIRECTORY/$FILE_NAME
# which means a specific file path or:
#   $DIRECTORY/*.$FILE_EXTENSION
# which means any file 1 level deep in that directory with a certain file extension.
#
# For a detailed guide, see: <https://github.com/actions/labeler>.
#
# For a real example:
A-consensus: # This is the tag name
- changed-files: # Any changed file...
  - any-glob-to-any-file: consensus/** # ...within the `consensus/` directory
                                       # will cause the `github-actions` bot
                                       # to add the `A-consensus` tag.
