//! Tx-pool Database tables.
//!
//! # Table marker structs
//! This module contains all the table definitions used by [`cuprate_txpool`](crate).
//!
//! The zero-sized structs here represents the table type;
//! they all are essentially marker types that implement [`cuprate_database::Table`].
//!
//! Table structs are `CamelCase`, and their static string
//! names used by the actual database backend are `snake_case`.
//!
//! For example: [`TransactionBlobs`] -> `transaction_blobs`.
//!
//! # Traits
//! This module also contains a set of traits for
//! accessing _all_ tables defined here at once.
