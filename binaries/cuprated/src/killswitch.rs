//! Killswitch.
//!
//! This module implements code for shutting down `cuprated`
//! after a certain timestamp has passed.
//!
//! The reasoning is twofold:
//! 1. Limiting the effects of any network errors
//!    caused by a faulty `cuprated`.
//! 2. To enforce users to update `alpha` builds,
//!    if they choose to run them.
//!
//! This behavior is limited to an alpha build;
//! this module will be removed after a stable v1 release.
