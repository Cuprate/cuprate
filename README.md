Cuprate will be an alternative Monero node written from the ground up in Rust. It 
will be able to independently validate Monero consensus rules providing a layer of 
security and redundancy for the Monero network.

Cuprate will help to protect the network from implementation bugs that could 
cause a variety of issues, plus because it's written in a memory safe language Cuprate 
will be less likely to suffer from memory safety issues compared to monerod.
