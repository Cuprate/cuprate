//! ### Table module
//! This module contains the definition of the [`Table`] and [`DupTable`] trait, and the actual tables used in the database.
//! [`DupTable`] are just a trait used to define that they support DUPSORT|DUPFIXED operation (as of now we don't know the equivalent for HSE).
//! All tables are defined with docs explaining its purpose, what types are the key and data.
//! For more details please look at Cuprate's book : <link to cuprate book>
